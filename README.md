## Welcome!

For most websites all I really need is to have a menu, some routing and a couple
of pages. Or I just want some very basic behaviour like tabs, popups, dialogs,
maybe a carousel. Most websites just aren't really that complicated, and really
don't warrant a full Javascript framework in my opinion.

However, I did find myself rewriting these few bits of Javascript in some form
or another time and time again. Which started to get annoying.

So, in the spirit of [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/), I guess this
collection of snippets is my attempt at a non-framework framework ðŸŽˆ

### Getting started
